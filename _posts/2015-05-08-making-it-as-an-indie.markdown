Again there is talk around the blogosphere about the difficulty of making it as an indie developer.

First there was [this post](http://blog.soff.es/redacted-for-mac-launch/) by Sam Soffes regarding the first-day sales after the launch of his Mac app, [Redacted](https://itunes.apple.com/app/redacted/id984968384?mt=12&uo=6&at=1l3vox5&ct=devblog). Day 1 saw the app at #8 top paid overall and #1 top paid in graphics and design in the US App Store with 59 sales.

Daniel Jalkut quite rightly [pointed out](https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/596160308328210432) that the top paid ranking is _not_ the important one - rather top grossing is.

Looking up Redacted's rankings on [AppFigures](http://appfigures.com) for the last few days reveals this graph for Top Paid rankings:

And this graph for top grossing rankings:

When Redacted was ranked #8 top paid, it was at the same time #42 top grossing. This top grossing rank was achieved with approximately US$206 in revenue ($4.99 * 59 sales * 70%).

Considering the curve gets steeper the higher the rank, this means that higher-ranked apps are earning considerably more than this.

[Dan Counsell revealed his figures](http://dancounsell.com/articles/product-revenue-snapshot) for Clear for Mac (amongst other apps) for the same day, noting that they've had better days and worse days. Selling at US$9.99, it was ranked #15 top paid and #35 top grossing. He cites Clear's revenue for that day (he doesn't specify whether it was US-only or world-wide) as about US$454.

##It's not as bad as it sounds

The Mac App Store is a _lot_ smaller than the iOS store. 61.1 million iPhones + 12.6 million iPads versus 4.5 million Macs in a quarter ([source](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q2fy15datasum.pdf)) is a _big_ difference. I would _expect_ the OS X app market to be tiny in comparison to that for iOS.

However, the Mac App store is not the only place to sell Mac Apps. [Look again at Dan Counsell's figures](http://dancounsell.com/articles/product-revenue-snapshot) for one day of sales of his Mac apps. I've added them up for you:

* $520.17 on the Mac App Store for Clear and Ember.
* $1657.05 _direct_ sales/upgrades for Ember, RapidWeaver and Typed.

In other words, with some effort it is possible to earn as much or even a lot more _outside_ of the App Store than in it.

##If a trivial app with almost no marketingâ€¦

[Sam Soffes said](http://blog.soff.es/redacted-for-mac-launch/) that he only sent out a couple of tweets about Redacted to announce its launch, although the app fortuitously did end up on Product Hunt and apparently got quite some attention there. The result - halfway decent first day sales. The app itself is rather simple and other apps with quite similar functionality already exist on the store.

This tells me that with a bit of effort and a good product, it shouldn't be _that_ difficult to generate a half-way decent revenue on the Mac App Store alone. And when you add direct sales into the mix, it looks even more attractive.

##Always look on the bright side

Rather than dampen my enthusiasm for getting my feet wet in publishing apps for the Mac sometime down the track, I am actually energised after reading Sam Soffe's story and Dan Counsell's follow-up.

My flagship app, [SongSheet for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id581094194?mt=8&at=1l3vox5&ct=devblog) is doing a _lot_ better than when I first wrote about it last year (I do plan on writing a follow-up post about this in the near future). It is an app that is _begging_ for a version that runs on OS X (In fact, I've had quite a few customers ask me when they can buy it!), and I plan to make the leap once I've got a few more things done on the iOS version first.

I've also taken on another new app project, [Reverse Chord Finder](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id379856345?ls=1&mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vox5&ct=devblog), for which an OS X version also makes sense.

I believe that with a small number of core apps running across both iOS and OS X I, as an indie developer, should be able to do quite well for myself. The market _is_ there, it is just up to me to build the apps and market them.
