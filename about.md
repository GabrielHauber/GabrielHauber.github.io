Hi! My name is Gabriel Hauber and this is my blog. It's primarily about software development on iOS/Mac but other things may creep in from time to time ;)

Of course, my life consists of much more than just the software development work I do to keep myself and my family fed and housed: I am a husband and father; I am a writer (fiction) and reader (although I don't get to read as many novels as I used to when I was younger!); I love science - primarily physics, astronomy and mathematics; I am also a 'theologian' and 'teacher' in a small house church that our family has hosted for a number of years now; I am also working slowly towards a Masters of Divinity degree. And, for something a little out of the ordinary, I also practise polyphasic sleeping.

As a developer I'm always keen to tackle new projects. If you have something you'd like me to help out with I am available for casual consultation as well as larger-scale contracts. Please email me through my contact details below!
